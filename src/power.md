## Power System

Quori's power system was designed to operate untethered with the use of a 12V 40AH battery, which is also used as a counter balance. The battery is a Sealed Lead Acid (SLA) Absorbent Glass Mat (AGM) chemistry battery that is affordable (compared to lithium-based batteries) and stable without losing charge over long periods and has minimal risk of fires or acid spill. %

Shipping is also simplified as the battery only requires the use of a sticker stating ``non-spillable battery'' instead of additional regulations or costs. A potential downside of SLA batteries is the low energy density and high mass; however, we take advantage of this as a counterbalance, as discussed in Section~\ref{subsubsec:TorsoDesign}.

Most of the robot's subsystems are 12V-based; the only significant voltage switching occurs in a DC-to-AC power inverter, which allows for a main computer (e.g., a laptop) to be used on Quori without requiring the selection or design of an additional DC-to-DC voltage regulator. A simplified diagram of components is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:powerOver}.

The robot can also run in a tethered mode when not mobile.
