Quori is a novel, socially interactive robot for facilitating non-contact human-robot interaction (HRI) research, both in the lab and in the wild. Quori aims to provide an affordable, high-quality platform that allows HRI researchers to conduct meaningful user studies by deploying systems in the real world. The Quori platform includes both hardware and software to help facilitate HRI. Quori was designed and produced with support from the National Science
Foundation Computing Research Infrastructure grant, which included the support for ten Quori platforms to be distributed to researchers in a competitive project proposal process

See the [General Use](general_use.md) section for more information on how to use Quori.


## Community-Informed Hardware

The following design of Quori is a result of the computing community input over three years of surveys and workshops. Quori is a low-cost, socially interactive robot platform comprised of an upper-body humanoid with a rear-projection head/face and two gesturing arms mounted atop an omnidirectional mobile base, standing at approximately 1.4 meters tall.

Sensors are integrated to provide useful data for recognizing and making decisions about interactions with both the environment and human users. The robot is designed for non-contact HRI tasks, such as person-tracking, performing expressive arm gestures, and displaying expressive facial features.

The hardware has an extensible yet simple software architecture and a standard mechanical and electrical interface for actuated and passive hardware elements. The software design involves novel general algorithms and robust code bases that enable the hardware platform to operate “out of the box” with a set of social behavior primitives enabling computing researchers to focus on their areas of interest without having to develop low-level robot control algorithms and code.
