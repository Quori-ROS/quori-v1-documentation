# Introduction

This is the official documentation of the [Quori robot v1](quori.md).

Quori owners should refer to the [General Use](general_use.md) section,
to learn about the robot's maintenance and operation.
See also the [assembly instructions](setup/assembly.md) if you have just received a robot.

If the robot is already setup,
and developers should refer to the [Software](software.md) section,
to modify that behavior.


## Development Team

The Quori Team is a collaboration between the [University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) Modlab](http://www.modlabupenn.org) and the [University of California (USC) Interaction Lab](http://robotics.usc.edu/interaction). USC and UPenn are joined by [Semio](https://semio.ai), a social robotics software company.

This project is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Computing Research Infrastructure (CRI) Collaborative grant CNS-1513275 and CNS-1513108.


## Technical Support

Quoriâ€™s modular architecture is intended to enable users to easily maintain and upgrade the hardware without need for custom maintenance or support personnel. Support for each robot will be available for up to one (1) year from its delivery. All awarded research teams are invited to send personnel to the University of Pennsylvania to receive hardware training and support, and/or to Semio for software training and support. Semio software and support will be available under free for fair use terms to non-commercial users.
