# Reception and Shipment
Quori was designed to facilitate transportation. This is achieved by the three main modules being able to be separated: the head, torso, and base. The torso and base with the battery and other parts can be stored in the provided pelican case during transportation. The head module ships in a small cardboard box which can be reused. It is recommended that you keep all shipping materials if you plan on transporting Quori over longer distances. The panels should be handled with care during shipping.
